Depending how this docker container was started, the standard usage is:
  * "/home/bosh" should be a docker volume with persisted data.
  * "/data" should also be a docker volume with persisted data, but shared with other instances of this container.
  * All other paths in this container will be reseted on restart or update.
  
For security reasons:
  1. Add you RSA public key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys,
  2. Before logout, ensure you can log with private/public key authentication,
  3. Password authentication become disabled.
  4. If you don't do this, your password will be resetted at container restart or update.

If you want to add your own environment variables, please add them to ~/.profile (such as http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy...).
